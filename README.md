This project creates and trains a model to classify several kinds of skin lessions.  Data was downloaded from Harvard Dataverse at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T.  Images from part1 and 2 were combined into a single "Images" folder.  The model was able to produce results with an accuracy of 86%.
